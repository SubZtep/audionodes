        Audio Nodes are a significant part of the <strong>Web Audio API</strong>, provide the
        capability to process audio just like in a professional desktop application. In this page I
        just try some of the existing nodes, surely to achieve the imagined goal the scriptable{" "}
        <code>AudioWorklet</code> interface is to look forward.

        Layout is a copycat of the amazing <a href="https://github.com/jdan/98.css">98.css</a> demo
        page. I think this oldskool design and web audio matching, both trigger similar feelings.
